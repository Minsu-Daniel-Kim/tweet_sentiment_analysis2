# tweet_sentiment_analysis

Stat 154 Final Project

This is a winning solution for tweet sentiment analysis!

There are two folders named python and R
Our models are implemented and written using both python and R. We began our analysis and basic model implementation in R, and did data processing and final version of models in Python. So, R code is more thorough, and hence, we recommend to read R code first and then move on to Python code.

Our report is also provided and take a look at it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email (minsu.daniel.kim@gmail.com)
