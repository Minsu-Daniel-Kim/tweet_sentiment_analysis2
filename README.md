# tweet_sentiment_analysis

Stat 154 Final Project

There are mainly two folders, python and R
Our implementation is done in both python and R. We began our analysis and model implementation in R. So, R code is more thorough, and hence, we recommend to read R code first and then move into Python code.

In our project, we exclusively use grid search and feature expansion.
